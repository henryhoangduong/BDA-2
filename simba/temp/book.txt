Most likely, the cause of zero plants is some combination of these
things, impacting each other in difficult-to-predict ways. This, in
its simplest form, is what we mean by nonlinear. Systems are
not fully controllable and unpredictable. Relationships among
parts impact what happens.

You may have built a single piece of software that, for the most
part, operated in a relatively controlled environment. When I
did that, I couldn't always predict what would happen when I
pushed a change to production. But for the most part, I could
mitigate the risk of unexpected outcomes.

Some bad news: nonlinear approaches are invariably more
difficult than linear ones. Your life is not about to get easier.
Does this make you want to throw the book across the room?
You already have so much to do. Now I'm telling you that
nonlinear approaches involve doing the work and figuring out
how to do the work and improving the ways we work and
clarifying why the work matters and learning…all the time.
Learning all the time. Thinking deeply and also thinking deeply
about thinking.
